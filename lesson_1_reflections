How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Well, if there is a right one, the diff shown will be probably pointing the correct code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can see the changes that were made and this means seeing your progress like a programmer.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Google docs could overload "trash" in someway but makes you losing nothing. Git is exactly the oposite.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I'm not sure, but i'll risk that Google Docs is not a version control system itself.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show you all the commits you've done and git diff will compare the differences bitween files of differents commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    A VCS was ment to give you this confidance by facilitating going further or back in the process.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
